The circuit shown in this folder is a 4-bit 2's complement adder-subtractor with an overflow LED. 

Tackling the adding component first, this circuit adds by using a simple adder chip (74LS283) and taking each input (A4-A1 and B4-B1) 
and wiring it with the correct input on the adder chip (A4 from dipswitch to A4 on adder chip and so on). 
This gives us the addition summation in binary format.

Moving on to the subtraction aspect, the circuit simply adds a negative number (A + (-B)). This is done with the use of an XOR chip as the truth table alligns with our goals.
The truth table of an XOR chip is
