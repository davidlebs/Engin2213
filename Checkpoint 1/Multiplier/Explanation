The circuit shown in this folder is a 4-bit unsigned multiplier.

The circuit is derived from the idea of binary multiplication and the fact that addition is communicative.
In binary multiplication, we take the LSB (least significant bit) of the bottom row and multiply it with the 
top row going from LSB to MSB (most signifcant bit) like in decimal multiplication. We then continue on with this 
pattern, going from LSB to MSB of the bottom row and multiplying with each number of the top row. At the end,
we add up all numbers and since addition is communicative, the order in which we add the numbers doesn't matter.
For the LSB LED, we give it an input of A1B1 as in multiplication, if another term is added below, we add a zero so 
the answer for the column just comes out to A1B1. The same logic is applied for the second adder. The summation
and Cout is then carried into the next adder to add with the ongoing addition. The final adder finally outputs
the rest of the LEDS with Cout of the last adder being the MSB.
