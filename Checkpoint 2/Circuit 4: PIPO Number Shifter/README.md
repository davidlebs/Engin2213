This file is a possible idea for one of the components we need for the design project. It uses a PIPO Shift Register, Comparator, and
Adder to shift positions by plus or minus 1. For the design project, we need a component which will be able to traverse the xy-plane
while being able to detect colisions. This circuit does this but only in 1 direction and only for collisions with the border 
(0 and 9 in this situation).
